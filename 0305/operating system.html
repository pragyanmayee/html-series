		<h1>Operating System Tutorial</h1>
		<p>Operating System Tutorial provides the basic and advanced concepts of operating system . Our Operating system tutorial is designed for beginners, professionals and GATE aspirants. We have designed this tutorial after the completion of a deep research about every concept.</p>
		<p>The content is described in detailed manner and has the ability to answer most of your queries. The tutorial also contains the numerical examples based on previous year GATE questions which will help you to address the problems in a practical manner.</p>
		<p>Operating System can be defined as an interface between user and the hardware. It provides an environment to the user so that, the user can perform its task in convenient and efficient way.</p>
		<p>The Operating System Tutorial is divided into various parts based on its functions such as Process Management, Process Synchronization, Deadlocks and File Management.</p>

		<h1>Operating System Definition and Function</h1>
		<p>In the Computer System (comprises of Hardware and software), Hardware can only understand machine code (in the form of 0 and 1) which doesn't make any sense to a naive user</p>
		<p>We need a system which can act as an intermediary and manage all the processes and resources present in the system.</p>
		<p>An Operating System can be defined as an interface between user and hardware. It is responsible for the execution of all the processes, Resource Allocation, CPU management, File Management and many other tasks.</p>
		<p>The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in convenient and efficient manner.</p> 

		<h1>Structure of a Computer System</h1>
		<p>A Computer System consists of:</p>
Users (people who are using the computer)<br/>
Application Programs (Compilers, Databases, Games, Video player, Browsers, etc.)<br/>
System Programs (Shells, Editors, Compilers, etc.)<br/>
Operating System ( A special program which acts as an interface between user and hardware )<br/>
Hardware ( CPU, Disks, Memory, etc)<br/>
