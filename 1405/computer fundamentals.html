		<h1>What is Computer?</h1>
		<a href="#basicparts">The basic parts without which a computer cannot work</a><br/>
		<a href="#basictypes">different types based on different criteria</a><br/>
		<a href="#benefits">Benefits of Using a Computer</a><br/>
		<p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" which means to calculate.</p>
		<p>A computer is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions through integrated hardware and software components. It works with the help of programs and represents the decimal numbers through a string of binary digits. It also has a memory that stores the data, programs, and result of processing. The components of a computer such as machinery that includes wires, transistors, circuits, hard disk are called hardware. Whereas, the programs and data are called software.</p>
		<p>It is believed that the Analytical Engine was the first computer which was invented by Charles Babbage in 1837. It used punch cards as read-only memory. Charles Babbage is also known as the father of the computer.</p>
		<h3 id="basicparts">The basic parts without which a computer cannot work are as follows:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Processor: It executes instructions from software and hardware.</li>
			<li>Memory: It is the primary memory for data transfer between the CPU and storage.</li>
			<li>Motherboard: It is the part that connects all other parts or components of a computer.</li>
			<li>Storage Device: It permanently stores the data, e.g., hard drive.</li>
			<li>Input Device: It allows you to communicate with the computer or to input data, e.g., a keyboard.</li>
			<li>Output Device: It enables you to see the output, e.g., monitor.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="basictypes">Computers are divided into different types based on different criteria. Based on the size, a computer can be divided into five types:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Micro Computer</li>
			<li>Mini Computer</li>
			<li>Mainframe Computer</li>
			<li>Super Computer</li>
			<li>Workstations</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>1. Micro Computer:</h2>
		<p>It is a single-user computer which has less speed and storage capacity than the other types. It uses a microprocessor as a CPU. The first microcomputer was built with 8-bit microprocessor chips. The common examples of microcomputers include laptops, desktop computers, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablets, and smartphones. Microcomputers are generally designed and developed for general usage like browsing, searching for information, internet, MS Office, social media, etc.</p>
		<h2>2. Mini Computer:</h2>
		<p>Mini-computers are also known as "Midrange Computers." They are not designed for a single. They are multi-user computers designed to support multiple users simultaneously. So, they are generally used by small businesses and firms. Individual departments of a company use these computers for specific purposes. For example, the admission department of a University can use a Mini-computer for monitoring the admission process.</p>
		<h2>3. Mainframe Computer:</h2>
		<p>It is also a multi-user computer capable of supporting thousands of users simultaneously. They are used by large firms and government organizations to run their business operations as they can store and process large amounts of data. For example, Banks, universities, and insurance companies use mainframe computers to store the data of their customers, students, and policyholders, respectively.</p>
		<h2>4. Super Computer:</h2>
		<p>Super-computers are the fastest and most expensive computers among all types of computers. They have huge storage capacities and computing speeds and thus can perform millions of instructions per second. The super-computers are task-specific and thus used for specialized applications such as large-scale numerical problems in scientific and engineering disciplines including applications in electronics, petroleum engineering, weather forecasting, medicine, space research and more. For example, NASA uses supercomputers for launching space satellites and monitoring and controlling them for space exploration.</p>
		<h2>5. Work stations:</h2>
		<p>It is a single-user computer. Although it is like a personal computer, it has a more powerful microprocessor and a higher-quality monitor than a microcomputer. In terms of storage capacity and speed, it comes between a personal computer and minicomputer. Work stations are generally used for specialized applications such as desktop publishing, software development, and engineering designs.</p>

		<a href="#super">Supercomputer</a><br/>
		<a href="#mainframe">Mainframe computer</a><br/>
		<a href="#miniframe">Miniframe or Minicomputer</a><br/>
		<a href="#work">workstation</a><br/>
		<a href="#micro">microcomputer</a><br/>

		<p>Analogue computers directly accept the data from the measuring device without first converting it into numbers and codes. They measure the continuous changes in physical quantity and generally render output as a reading on a dial or scale. Speedometer and mercury thermometer are examples of analogue computers.</p>
		<h3>Advantages of using analogue computers:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It allows real-time operations and computation at the same time and continuous representation of all data within the rage of the analogue machine.</li>
			<li>In some applications, it allows performing calculations without taking the help of transducers for converting the inputs or The programmer can scale the problem for the dynamic range of the analogue computer. It provides insight into the problem and helps understand the errors and their effects.</li>
		</ul>
			<h3>Types of analogue computers:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Slide Rules: It is one of the simplest types of mechanical analogue computers. It was developed to perform basic mathematical calculations. It is made of two rods. To perform the calculation, the hashed rod is slid to line up with the markings on another rod.</li>

			<li>The cost of hardware is less due to the advancement in the IC technology.</li>
			<li>It offers high speed as the data is processed digitally.</li>
			<li>It is highly reliable as it uses error correction codes.</li>
			<li>Reproducibility of results is higher as the output is not affected by noise, temperature, humidity, and other properties of its components.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Hybrid Computer</h3>
		<p>Hybrid computer has features of both analogue and digital computer. It is fast like an analogue computer and has memory and accuracy like digital computers. It can process both continuous and discrete data. It accepts analogue signals and convert them into digital form before processing. So, it is widely used in specialized applications where both analogue and digital data is processed. For example, a processor is used in petrol pumps that converts the measurements of fuel flow into quantity and price. Similarly, they are used in airplanes, hospitals, and scientific applications.</p>
		<h3>Advantages of using hybrid computers:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Its computing speed is very high due to the all-parallel configuration of the analogue subsystem.</li>
			<li>It produces precise and quick results that are more accurate and useful.</li>

		<h1>history of computer</h1>
		<p>The first counting device was used by the primitive people. They used sticks, stones and bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with time more computing devices were developed. Some of the popular computing devices starting with the first to recent ones are described below;</p>
		<h2 id="abacus">Abacus</h2>
		<img src="./images/abacus1.png" alt="abacus" /> 
		<p>The history of computer begins with the birth of abacus which is believed to be the first computer. It is said that Chinese invented Abacus around 4,000 years ago.

It was a wooden rack which has metal rods with beads mounted on them. The beads were moved by the abacus operator according to some rules to perform arithmetic calculations. Abacus is still used in some countries like China, Russia and Japan. An image of this tool is shown below;</p>
		<h2 id="napier">Napier's Bones</h2>
		<img src="./images/napier-bones1.png" alt="napier-bones1"/>
		<p>It was a manually-operated calculating device which was invented by John Napier (1550-1617) of Merchiston. In this calculating tool, he used 9 different ivory strips or bones marked with numbers to multiply and divide. So, the tool became known as "Napier's Bones. It was also the first machine to use the decimal point.</P>
		<h2 id="pascaline">Pascaline</h2> 
		<img src="./images/pascaline1.png" alt="pascaline1"/> 
		<p>Pascaline is also known as Arithmetic Machine or Adding Machine. It was invented between 1642 and 1644 by a French mathematician-philosopher Biaise Pascal. It is believed that it was the first mechanical and automatic calculator.

Pascal invented this machine to help his father, a tax accountant. It could only perform addition and subtraction. It was a wooden box with a series of gears and wheels. When a wheel is rotated one revolution, it rotates the neighboring wheel. A series of windows is given on the top of the wheels to read the totals. An image of this tool is shown below;</p>
		<h2 id="stepped reckoner">Stepped Reckoner or Leibnitz wheel</h2>
		<img src="./images/stepped-reckoner-or-leibnitz-wheel1.png" alt="stepped-reckoner-or-leibnitz-wheel1"/>
		<p>It was developed by a German mathematician-philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz in 1673. He improved Pascal's invention to develop this machine. It was a digital mechanical calculator which was called the stepped reckoner as instead of gears it was made of fluted drums. See the following image;</p>
		<h2 id="diffrence engine">Difference Engine</h2>
		<img src="./images/difference-engine1.png" alt="difference-engine1"/>
		<p>In the early 1820s, it was designed by Charles Babbage who is known as "Father of Modern Computer". It was a mechanical computer which could perform simple calculations. It was a steam driven calculating machine designed to solve tables of numbers like logarithm tables.</p>

		<a href="#operations">Operations of Computer Components</a><br/>
		<p>Computer components are the essential building parts of developing a functional computer system. The components that make up a computer are called computer components. The processor (CPU), memory, and input/output devices are every computer's three main building blocks. Initially computers were primarily used for numerical computations because any information can be numerically encoded. The ability of computers to interpret information for several purposes was quickly recognized.</p>
		<p>There are 5 main computer components that are given below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Input Devices</li>
			<li>CPU</li>
			<li>Output Devices</li>
			<li>Primary Memory</li>
			<li>Secondary Memory</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="./images/computer-components.png" />
		<h2 id="input">Input devices</h2>
		<p>A computer system's input devices are important because they allow users to enter commands and data. Keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones are numerous examples of input devices.</p>
		<img src="./images/input.png" />
		<ul>
			<li>The keyboard is the most commonly utilized input device for inserting text and queries into a computer system.</li>
			<li>Mice are another common input tool used to move the cursor on a computer screen.</li>
			<li>Scanners are used for inputting physical documents or images into a computer system.</li>
			<li>Microphones are used to input audio data into a system for computing. They can be used for various tasks, including recording audio for podcasts, participating in video conferences, and creating voice memos for later use.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2>
		<p>A computer machine's "brain" is its central processing unit (CPU). It executes the calculations and commands required for functioning of the computer device. The CPU comprises some components: the control unit, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers.</p>
		<img src="./images/cpu.png" />
		<ul>
			<li>The CPU's control unit is a crucial component. It is in charge of reading and decoding instructions from memory. The right part of the CPU receives and executes these instructions from the control unit.</li>
			<li>The ALU, often known as the arithmetic logic unit, is another crucial CPU part. The ALU operates addition, subtraction, comparison calculations, and other logical and mathematical processes. These operations are carried out using binary logic, which limits operations to the 0 and 1 digits.</li>
			<li>Registers are compact, high-speed data and instruction storage spaces within the CPU. They are utilized to store data that is being processed by the CPU momentarily. Registers are used to accelerate data processing because they are much faster than other forms of memory, such as RAM.</li>
			<li>The CPU's clock speed is yet another crucial aspect that affects overall performance. The clock speed, measured in GHz (gigahertz), controls what number of commands the integral processing unit can process in a second.</li>
		</ul>
				<p>Modern CPUs also have additional features like cache memory, virtualization capability, and a couple of cores in addition to the abovementioned components. A small, quick memory called a cache is used to store data and instructions that are utilized frequently. A single CPU may run numerous operating systems thanks to virtualization capability. The CPU can execute numerous tasks simultaneously thanks to multiple cores, enhancing its performance and multitasking capabilities.</p>


		<h2 id="primary">Primary Memory</h2>
		<p>The CPU has direct access to primary memory, sometimes referred to as random access memory (RAM). The data and instructions that are currently being processed are kept in primary memory. The data and instructions are accessed by the CPU from primary memory when a computer programme is running. The information is removed from primary memory once the programme is completed.</p>
		<img src="./images/primarymemory.png" />
		<ul>
			<li>RAM is the most common form of primary memory and is used to store data and instructions that the CPU wishes to access frequently. RAM is volatile, which means that its contents are lost when the computer is turned off. But RAM can be effortlessly and quickly written to and read from, making it a really perfect storage medium for temporary data and instructions.</li>
			<li>ROM is a form of memory this is used to store data and instructions that don't change. ROM is non-volatile, which means that its contents aren't lost while the computer is turned off. ROM is used to keep firmware and the laptop's basic input/Output machine (BIOS), that are required for the computer to boot up and function well.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Other primary memory types, including cache memory, are sometimes used in computer systems. High-speed memory called cache saves information and instructions, which might be utilized often. By lowering the time, the CPU has to wait for data to be received from RAM or secondary storage devices, it is used to speed up the processing of records.</p>


		<h2 id="secondary">Secondary Memory:</h2>
		<p>Secondary memory, also called auxiliary storage, is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and programs that aren't currently being utilized by the CPU. In contrast to primary memory, secondary memory is non-volatile, which means that its contents are not lost when the computer is turned off.</p>
		<img src="./images/secondrymemory.png" />
		<p>There are several types of secondary memory devices, such as hard disk drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), optical disks (including CDs and DVDs), and USB flash drives. These devices have varying storage capacities, read and write speeds, and different capabilities that make them appropriate for different types of applications.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hard disc drives are the most typical secondary memory tool in computing devices and laptop computers. They come in various sizes and speeds and keep data on magnetic discs. However, solid-state drives employ flash memory to store data and are typically quicker and more reliable despite being extra high-priced than HDDs.</li>
			<li>Optical discs are a secondary memory that reads and writes data to discs using lasers. They are frequently used for data backup, distribution of software, and other digital information. Small, portable storage devices known as USB flash drives are connected to a computer's USB connection.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Users can store a lot of data and programmes in secondary memory, which is useful since it makes them accessible fast and readily when needed. Users can also protect crucial data from loss due to system crashes or other issues by using secondary memory devices as backups.</p>
		
		<h2 id="output">Output Devices</h2>
		<p>Output devices are hardware components of a computer system that are used to show or send data from the pc to the user or any other device. They enable customers to view and engage with the information and applications the computer is processing. Speakers, projectors, printers, and monitors are a few examples of output devices.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Monitors are the most frequently used output devices used to show data on a computer machine. They may be used to show photos, videos, and different forms of data and exist in various sizes and resolutions.</li>
			<li>Printers are another form of output device this is used to print hard copies of papers and other styles of data. They include inkjet and laser printers and are available in various sizes and brands. While laser printers utilize toner to make speedy, high-volume prints, inkjet printers employ liquid ink to produce high-quality prints.</li>
			<li>Speakers are used to output sound from a computer system. They can be connected externally or incorporated into the computer system. They enable users to interact with other forms of multimedia material, view videos, and listen to music.</li>
			<li>Projectors are output device that displays huge images and videos on a screen or wall. They are frequently utilized in presentations and other occasions that call for a sizable display.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="operations">Operations of Computer Components</h2>
		<p>The operations of computer components are given below:</p>
		<p>Computer components collaborate to carry out the numerous tasks necessary for a computer system to run. The following are some of the major operations carried out by computer components:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Inputting: It is the process of entering raw data, instructions and information into the computer. Keyboards, mice, and scanners are used as input devices to help with the process. These tools are used to enter information and instructions into a computer system. Data is transferred to the CPU for processing after inputting by an input device.</li>
			<li>Processing: It is the process of converting the raw data into useful information. This process is performed by the CPU of the computer. It takes the raw data from storage, processes it and then sends back the processed data to storage. The CPU performs arithmetic computations, logical operations, and data transport processes.</li>
			<li>Storing: The computer has primary memory and secondary storage to store data and instructions. It stores the data before sending it to CPU for processing and also stores the processed data before displaying it as output. The primary memory, sometimes called RAM, is where the CPU processes the data and instructions. Hard disc drives and solid-state drives, which serve as secondary memory, offer long-term storage for data and programmes that are not currently used.</li>
			<li>Outputting: It is the process of presenting the processed data through output devices like monitor, printer and speakers. These devices display or produce the results of the processing performed by the CPU. The results are sent to an output device for display or printing after the CPU has finished processing the data and instructions.</li>
			<li>Controlling: This operation is performed by the control unit that is part of CPU. The control unit ensures that all basic operations are executed in a right manner and sequence. The main circuit board connects all the parts of the computer. It also regulates the data flow between them, ensuring they function properly and connecting them all.</li>

		<h2 id="keyboard">1) Keyboard</h2>
		<p>The keyboard is a basic input device that is used to enter data into a computer or any other electronic device by pressing keys. It has different sets of keys for letters, numbers, characters, and functions. Keyboards are connected to a computer through USB or a Bluetooth device for wireless communication.</p>
		<p>Types of keyboards: There can be different types of keyboards based on the region and language used. Some of the common types of keyboards are as follows:</p>
		<h3>i) QWERTY Keyboard:</h3>
		<img src = "./images/keyboard.jpg"/>
		<p>It is the most commonly used keyboard with computers in modern times. It is named after the first six letters of the top row of buttons and is even popular in countries that do not use Latin-based alphabet. It is so popular that some people think that it is the only type of keyboard to use with computers as an input device.</p>
		<h3>ii) AZERTY Keyboard:</h3>
		<img src="./images/azerty-keyboard.png" />
		<p>It is considered the standard French keyboard. It is developed in France as an alternative layout to the QWERTY layout and is mainly used in France and other European countries. Some countries have manufactured their own versions of AZERTY.</p>
		<p>Its name is derived from the first six letters that appear on the top left row of the keyboard. The Q and W keys in AZERTY keyboard are interchanged with A and Z keys in QWERTY keyboard. Furthermore, in AZERTY keyboard M key is located to the left of the L key.</p>
		<p>AZERTY keyboard differs from QWERTY keyboard not only in the placement of letters but also in many other ways, e.g., it gives emphasis on accents, which is required for writing European languages like French.</p>

		<h3>iii) DVORAK Keyboard:</h3>
		<img src="./images/dvorak-keyboard.png"/>
		<p>This type of keyboard layout was developed to increase the typing speed by reducing the finger movement while typing. The most frequently used letters are kept in a home row to improve typing.</p>
		<h2 id="mouse">2) Mouse</h2>
		<p>The mouse is a hand-held input device which is used to move cursor or pointer across the screen. It is designed to be used on a flat surface and generally has left and right button and a scroll wheel between them. Laptop computers come with a touchpad that works as a mouse. It lets you control the movement of cursor or pointer by moving your finger over the touchpad. Some mouse comes with integrated features such as extra buttons to perform different buttons.</p>
		<p>The mouse was invented by Douglas C. Engelbart in 1963. Early mouse had a roller ball integrated as a movement sensor underneath the device. Modern mouse devices come with optical technology that controls cursor movements by a visible or invisible light beam. A mouse is connected to a computer through different ports depending on the type of computer and type of a mouse.</p>
		<h3>Common types of the mouse:</h3>
		<h4> i) Trackball Mouse:</h4>
		<img src="./images/trackball-mouse.png" />
		<p>It is a stationary input device that has ball mechanism to move the pointer or cursor on the screen. The ball is half inserted in the device and can be easily rolled with finger, thumb or the palm to move the pointer on the screen. The device has sensor to detect the rotation of ball. It remains stationary; you don't need to move it on the operating surface. So, it is an ideal device if you have limited desk space as you don't need to move it like a mouse.</p>
		<h4>ii) Mechanical Mouse:</h4>
		<img src="./images/mechanical-mouse.png" />
		<p>It has a system of a ball and several rollers to track its movement. It is a corded type of mouse. A mechanical mouse can be used for high performance. The drawback is that they tend to get dust into the mechanics and thus require regular cleaning.</p>
		<h4>iii) Optical Mouse:</h4>
		<img src="./images/optical-mouse.png" />
		<p>An optical mouse uses optical electronics to track its movement. It is more reliable than a mechanical mouse and also requires less maintenance. However, its performance is affected by the surface on which it is operated. Plain non-glossy mouse mat should be used for best results. The rough surface may cause problems for the optical recognition system, and the glossy surface may reflect the light wrongly and thus may cause tracking issues.</p>
		<h4>iv) C./images/cordless.png"/ >
		<p>As the name suggests, this type of mouse lacks cable and uses wireless technology such as IrDA (infrared) or radio (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to control the movement of the cursor. It is used to improve the experience of using a mouse. It uses batteries for its power supply.</p>

		<h2 id="scanner">3) Scanner</h2>
		<p>The scanner uses the pictures and pages of text as input. It scans the picture or a document. The scanned picture or document then converted into a digital format or file and is displayed on the screen as an output. It uses optical character recognition techniques to convert images into digital ones. Some of the common types of scanners are as follows</p>
		<h3>Types of Scanner:</h3>
		<h4>i) Flatbed Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/scanner.jpg" />
		<p>It has a glass pane and a moving optical CIS or CCD array. The light illuminates the pane, and then the image is placed on the glass pane. The light moves across the glass pane and scans the document and thus produces its digital copy. You will need a transparency adapter while scanning transparent slides.</p>
		<h4>ii) Handheld Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/handheld-scanner.png" />
		<p>It is a small manual scanning device which is held by hand and is rolled over a flat image that is to be scanned. The drawback in using this device is that the hand should be steady while scanning; otherwise, it may distort the image. One of the commonly used handheld scanners is the barcode scanner which you would have seen in shopping stores.</p>
		<h4>iii) Sheetfed Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/sheetfed-scanner.png"/>
		<p>In this scanner, the document is inserted into the slot provided in the scanner. The main components of this scanner include the sheet-feeder, scanning module, and calibration sheet. The light does not move in this scanner. Instead, the document moves through the scanner. It is suitable for scanning single page documents, not for thick objects like books, magazines, etc.</p>
		<h4>iv) Drum Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/drum-scanner.png" />
		<p>Drum scanner has a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to scan images. It does not have a charge-coupled device like a flatbed scanner. The photomultiplier tube is extremely sensitive to light. The image is placed on a glass tube, and the light moves across the image, which produces a reflection of the image which is captured by the PMT and processed. These scanners have high resolution and are suitable for detailed scans.</p>
		<h4>v) Photo Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/photo-scanner.png" />
		<p>It is designed to scan photographs. It has high resolution and color depth, which are required for scanning photographs. Some photo scanners come with in-built software for cleaning and restoring old photographs.</p>

		<h2 id="joystick">4) Joystick</h2>
		<img src="./images/joystick.jpg" />
		<p>A joystick is also a pointing input device like a mouse. It is made up of a stick with a spherical base. The base is fitted in a socket that allows free movement of the stick. The movement of stick controls the cursor or pointer on the screen.</p>
		<p>The first joystick was invented by C. B. Mirick at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. A joystick can be of different types such as displacement joysticks, finger-operated joysticks, hand operated, isometric joystick, and more. In joystick, the cursor keeps moving in the direction of the joystick unless it is upright, whereas, in mouse, the cursor moves only when the mouse moves.</p>
		
		<h2 id="light pen">5) Light Pen</h2>
		<img src="./images/light-pen.gif" />
		<p>A light pen is a computer input device that looks like a pen. The tip of the light pen contains a light-sensitive detector that enables the user to point to or select objects on the display screen. Its light sensitive tip detects the object location and sends the corresponding signals to the CPU. It is not compatible with LCD screens, so it is not in use today. It also helps you draw on the screen if needed. The first light pen was invented around 1955 as a part of the Whirlwind project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>

		<h2 id="digitizer">6) Digitizer</h2>
		<img src="./images/digitizer.jpg" />
		<p>Digitizer is a computer input device that has a flat surface and usually comes with a stylus. It enables the user to draw images and graphics using the stylus as we draw on paper with a pencil. The images or graphics drawn on the digitizer appear on the computer monitor or display screen. The software converts the touch inputs into lines and can also convert handwritten text to typewritten words.</p>
		<p>It can be used to capture handwritten signatures and data or images from taped papers. Furthermore, it is also used to receive information in the form of drawings and send output to a CAD (Computer-aided design) application and software like AutoCAD. Thus, it allows you to convert hand-drawn images into a format suitable for computer processing.</p>

		<h2 id="microphone">7) Microphone</h2>
		<img src="./images/microphone.jpg" />
		<p>The microphone is a computer input device that is used to input the sound. It receives the sound vibrations and converts them into audio signals or sends to a recording medium. The audio signals are converted into digital data and stored in the computer. The microphone also enables the user to telecommunicate with others. It is also used to add sound to presentations and with webcams for video conferencing. A microphone can capture audio waves in different ways; accordingly the three most common types are described below:</p>
		<h4>i) Dynamic:</h4>
		<img src="./images/microphone.jpg" />
		<p>It is the most commonly used microphone with a simple design. It has a magnet which is wrapped by a metal coil and a thin sheet on the front end of the magnet. The sheet transfers vibrations from sound waves to the coil and from coil to electric wires which transmit the sound like an electrical signal.</p>
		<h4>ii) Condenser:</h4>
		<img src="./images/condenser.png" />
		<p>It is designed for audio recording and has a very sensitive and flat frequency response. It has a front plate called diaphragm and a back plate parallel to the front plate. When sound hits the diaphragm, it vibrates the diaphragm and alters the distance between the two plates. The changes in distance are transmitted as electric signals.</p>
		<h4>iii) Ribbon:</h4>
		<img src="./images/ribbon.png" />
		<p>It is known for its reliability. It has a thin ribbon made of aluminum, duraluminum, or nanofilm suspended in a magnetic field. The sound waves cause vibrations in the ribbon, which generate a voltage proportional to the velocity of the vibration. The voltage is transmitted as an electrical signal. Early ribbon microphones had a transformer to increase the output voltage, but modern ribbon microphones come with advanced magnets to produce a strong signal.</p>
		
		<h2 id="micr"> 8) Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)</h2>
		<img src="./images/micr.jpg" />
		<p>MICR computer input device is designed to read the text printed with magnetic ink. MICR is a character recognition technology that makes use of special magnetized ink which is sensitive to magnetic fields. It is widely used in banks to process the cheques and other organizations where security is a major concern. It can process three hundred cheques in a minute with hundred-percent accuracy. The details on the bottom of the cheque (MICR No.) are written with magnetic ink. A laser printer with MICR toner can be used to print the magnetic ink.</p>
		<p>The device reads the details and sends to a computer for processing. A document printed in magnetic ink is required to pass through a machine which magnetizes the ink, and the magnetic information is then translated into characters.</p>

		<h2 id="ocr"> 9) Optical Character Reader (OCR)</h2>
		<img src="./images/ocr.jpg" />
		<p>OCR computer input device is designed to convert the scanned images of handwritten, typed or printed text into digital text. It is widely used in offices and libraries to convert documents and books into electronic files.</p>
		<p>It processes and copies the physical form of a document using a scanner. After copying the documents, the OCR software converts the documents into a two-color (black and white), version called bitmap. Then it is analyzed for light and dark areas, where the dark areas are selected as characters, and the light area is identified as background. It is widely used to convert hard copy legal or historic documents into PDFs. The converted documents can be edited if required like we edit documents created in ms word.</p>

		<h2 id="digital camera"> 10) Digital camera:</h2>
		<img src="./images/digital-camera.jpg" />
		<p>It is a digital device as it captures images and records videos digitally and then stores them on a memory card. It is provided with an image sensor chip to capture images, as opposed to film used by traditional cameras. Besides this, a camera that is connected to your computer can also be called a digital camera.</p>
		<p>It has photosensors to record light that enters the camera through the lens. When the light strikes the photosensors, each of the sensors returns the electrical current, which is used to create the images.</p>

		<h2 id="paddle"> 11) Paddle:</h2>
		<img src="./images/paddle.jpg" />
		<p>It is a simple input device that is widely used in games. It is a wheel that is held by hand and looks like a volume knob on a stereo that is used to increase or decrease the volume. Paddle moves or controls cursor or any other objects in the game in a back-and-forth motion. It is widely used as an alternative to the joystick. Besides this, the term paddle also refers to many handheld devices designed to control a function in an electronic device, computer, etc.</p>

		<h2 id="steering wheel">12) Steering wheel:</h2>
		<img src="./images/steering-wheel.jpg" />

For example, Kinect is one such device that observes the movement of a player's body and interprets these movements as inputs to video games. This feature is also available in certain tablets and smartphones where you can perform certain tasks such as taking pictures using finger gestures such as swiping, pinching, etc.</p>

		<h2 id="light gun">14) Light Gun:</h2>
		<img src="./images/light-gun.jpg" />
		<p>As the name suggests, it is a pointing input device that is designed to point at and shoot the targets on the screen in a video game, or arcade, etc. The light gun was used for the first time on the MIT Whirwind computer. When the gun is pointed at the target on the screen and the trigger is pulled, the screen goes blank for a fraction of a second. During this moment, the photodiode, which is present in the barrel, determines where the gun is pointed. For example, shooting ducks in a duck hunt game.</p>

		<h2 id="touch pad">15) Touchpad:</h2>
		<img src="./images/touchpad.jpg" />
		<p>It is usually found in laptops as a substitute for the mouse. It allows you to move or control the cursor on the screen using your finger. Just like a mouse, it also has two buttons for right and left click. Using the touchpad, you can perform all the tasks that you do with a mouse, such as selecting an object on the screen, copy, paste, delete, open a file or folder, and more.</p>

		<h2 id="remote">16) Remote:</h2>
		<img src="./images/remote.jpg" />
		<p>It is a hardware device designed to control the functioning of a device, e.g., a TV remote that can be used to change channels, increase or decrease the volume, from a distance without leaving the seat. The first cordless TV remote was invented by Dr. Robert Adler of Zenith in 1956. The remote sends the electromagnetic waves to communicate with the device. These waves can be infrared rays, radio waves, etc.</p>

		<h2 id="touch screen">17) Touch screen:</h2>
		<img src="./images/touch-screen.jpg" />
		<p>It is the display screen of a device such as a smartphone, tablet, etc., that allows users to interact or provide inputs to the device by using their finger. Today, most of the electronic devices come with touchscreen as an alternative to a mouse for navigating a graphical user interface. For example, by touching, you can unlock your phone, open emails, open files, play videos, etc. Besides this, it is used in lots of devices such as Camera, Car GPS, Fitness machine, etc.</p>
		<p>The concept of the touch screen was first introduced and published by E.A. Johnson in 1965. The first touch screen was developed at the beginning of the 1970s by CERN engineers Frank Beck and Bent Stumpe.</p>

		<h2 id="VR">18) VR:</h2>
		<img src="./images/vr.jpg" />
		<p>VR stands for virtual reality. It is an artificial or virtual environment which is generated by computers. A person can interact with virtual objects of this artificial environment using some input devices such as headsets, gloves, headphones, etc. For example, he or she can find himself or herself walking on a beach, watching a football match, walking in the sky, etc., without actually doing all this.</p>

		<h2 id="webcam">19) Webcam:</h2>
		<img src="./images/webcam.jpg" />

		<p>Any camera which is connected to a computer is called a webcam. The in-built camera provided on a computer can also be considered a webcam. It is an input device as it can take pictures, and can be used to record videos if required. The pictures and videos are stored in the computer memory and can be displayed on the screen if required. Although it works almost the same as the digital camera, it is different from a digital camera, as it is designed to take compact digital photos that can be uploaded easily on the webpages and shared with others through the internet.</p>

		<h2 id="biometric">20) Biometric Devices:</h2>
		<p>Biometrics refers to a process in which a person is identified through his or her biological features such as fingerprints, eye cornea, face structure, etc. It is done by using biometric devices, which can be of different types based on their scanning features and abilities, such as:</p>
		<h4>i) Face Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/face-scanner.jpg" />
		<p>It is designed to identify a person by scanning his or her face. It takes the face measurements of a person. For example, the distance between eyes, nose, and mouth, etc., accordingly, it confirms the identity of a person. Besides this, it is smart enough to differentiate between a person's picture and the real person.</p>
		<h4>ii) Hand Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/hand-scanner.png" />
		<p>The hand of a person can also be used to verify his or her identity as every person has a unique pattern of veins in the palm, just like fingerprints. This device takes advantage of this feature; it identifies a person by scanning the palm of his hand. It uses infrared light to scan veins' patterns and blood flowing in them. Palm is even more unique than fingerprints.</p>
		<h4>iii) Fingerprint Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/fingerprint-scanner.jpg" />
		<p>It scans the fingerprints to identify people or for biometric authentication. This device is developed, keeping in mind the fact that no two persons in the world can have the same fingerprints. It is widely used in companies as a fingerprint attendance system to mark the attendance of employees. This type of scanners captures the pattern of valleys and ridges found on a finger and store it in the memory or database. When you press your finger on the given space, it verifies the identity by using its pattern-matching software.</p>
		<h4>iv) Retina or Iris Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/retina-or-iris-scanner.jpg" />
 		<p>It scans the retina or iris of a person's eye to confirm the identity. This device is more secure than others as it is next to impossible to copy the retina or iris. It works by mapping the retina's blood vessel patterns of the eye. The blood vessels of retina absorb light more easily as well as can be identified with appropriate lighting.</p>
		<p>In this scan, a beam of low-energy infrared light falls on the retina through the scanner's eyepiece. Then, the software captures the network of blood vessels in the retina and uses it to verify a person's identity.</p>
		<h4>v) Voice Scanner:</h4>
		<img src="./images/voice-scanner.jpg" />
 		<p>It records the voice of a person and digitizes it to create a distinctive voice print or template. The voiceprints are stored in the database, and are used to verify the voice of a person to confirm his or her identity. The person is required to speak in the normal or same voice that was used to create a voice template. It is not much reliable as it can be misused using a tape recording.</p>

		 <h2 id="monitor">1) Monitor</h2>
		 <p>The monitor is the display unit or screen of the computer. It is the main output device that displays the processed data or information as text, images, audio or video.</p>
		 <p>The types of monitors are given below</p>
		 <h3>i) CRT Monitor</h3>
		 <img src="./images/crt-monitor.jpg" />
		 <p>CRT monitors are based on the cathode ray tubes. They are like vacuum tubes which produce images in the form of video signals. Cathode rays tube produces a beam of electrons through electron guns that strike on the inner phosphorescent surface of the screen to produce images on the screen. The monitor contains millions of phosphorus dots of red, green and blue color. These dots start to glow when struck by electron beams and this phenomenon is called cathodoluminescence.</p>
		 <p>The main components of a CRT monitor include the electron gun assembly, deflection plate assembly, fluorescent screen, glass envelope, and base.The front (outer surface) of the screen onto which images are produced is called the face plate. It is made up of fiber optics.</p>
		 <p>There are three electron beams that strike the screen: red, green, and blue. So, the colors which you see on the screen are the blends of red, blue and green lights. The magnetic field guides the beams of electrons. Although LCDs have replaced the CRT monitors, the CRT monitors are still used by graphics professionals because of their color quality.</p>
		 <h3>ii) LCD Monitor</h3>
		 <img src="./images/lcd-monitor.jpg" />
		 <p>The LCD monitor is a flat panel screen that is compact and light-weight as compared to CRT monitors. It is based on liquid crystal display technology which is used in the screens of laptops, tablets, smart phones, etc. An LCD screen comprises two layers of polarized glass with a liquid crystal solution between them. When the light passes through the first layer, an electric current aligns the liquids crystals. The aligned liquid crystals allow a varying level of light to pass through the second layer to create images on the screen.</p>
		 <p>The LCD screen has a matrix of pixels that display the image on the screen. Old LCDs had passive-matrix screens in which individual pixels are controlled by sending a charge. A few electrical charges could be sent each second that made screens appear blurry when the images moved quickly on the screen.</p>
		 <p>Modern LCDs use active-matrix technology and contain thin film transistors (TFTs) with capacitors. This technology allows pixels to retain their charge. So, they don't make screen blurry when images move fast on the screen as well as are more efficient than passive-matrix displays.</p>
		 <h3>iii) LED monitor</h3>
		 <img src="./images/led-monitor.jpg" a/>
 
		 <p>The LED monitor is an improved version of an LCD monitor. It also has a flat panel display and uses liquid crystal display technology like the LCD monitors. The difference between them lies in the source of light to backlight the display. The LED monitor has many LED panels, and each panel has several LEDsto backlight the display, whereas the LCD monitors use cold cathode fluorescent light to backlight the display.Modern electronic devices such as mobile phones, LED TVs, laptop and computer screens, etc., use a LED display as it not only produces more brilliance and greater light intensity but also consumes less power.</p>
		 <h3>iv) Plasma Monitor</h3>
		 <img src="./images/plasma-monitor.jpg" />
		 <p>The plasma monitor is also a flat panel display that is based on plasma display technology. It has small tiny cells between two glass panels. These cells contain mixtures of noble gases and a small amount of mercury. When voltage is applied, the gas in the cells turns into a plasma and emits ultraviolet light that creates images on the screen, i.e., the screen is illuminated by a tiny bit of plasma, a charged gas. Plasma displays are brighter than liquid crystal displays (LCD) and also offer a wide viewing angle than an LCD.</p>
		 <p>Plasma monitors provide high resolutions of up to 1920 X 1080, excellent contrast ratios, wide viewing angle, a high refresh rate and more. Thus, they offer a unique viewing experience while watching action movies, sports games, and more.</p>
		 <h3>Applications of Monitor</h3>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Personal Computing: Monitors are commonly used in personal computers for everyday operations such as online surfing, document editing, video viewing, and gameplay.</li>

		 </ul>
 
 
		 <h2 id="projector">2) Projector</h2>
		 <img src="./images/projector.png" />
		 <p>A projector is an output device that enables the user to project the output onto a large surface such as a big screen or wall. It can be connected to a computer and similar devices to project their output onto a screen. It uses light and lenses to produce magnified texts, images, and videos. So, it is an ideal output device to give presentations or to teach a large number of people.</p>
		 <p>Modern projects (digital projectors) come with multiple input sources such as HDMI ports for newer equipment and VGA ports that support older devices. Some projectors are designed to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth as well. They can be fixed onto the ceiling, placed on a stand, and more and are frequently used for classroom teaching, giving presentations, home cinemas, etc.</p>
		 <p>A digital projector can be of two types:</p>
		 <ol>
			 <li>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) digital projector: This type of digital projectors are very popular as they are lightweight and provide crisp output. An LCD projector uses transmissive technology to produce output. It allows the light source, which is a standard lamp, to pass through the three colored liquid crystal light panels. Some colors pass through the panels and some are blocked by the panels and thus images are on the screen.</li>
			 <li>Digital Light Processing (DLP) digital projector: It has a set of tiny mirrors, a separate mirror for each pixel of the image and thus provide high-quality images. These projectors are mostly used in theatres as they fulfill the requirement of high-quality video output.</li>
		 </ol>

Printers enable the generation of tangible copies for record-keeping, presentations, marketing materials, and other purposes, from household to professional settings. Printers are essential for personal and commercial use due to their simplicity and adaptability.</p>
		 <p>Based on the printing mechanism, the printers are of two types: Impact Printers and Non-impact Printers.</p>
		 <h5>Impact Printers: They are of two types:</h5>
		 <ol>
			 <li>Character Printers
				 <ul>
					 <li>Dot Matrix printers</li>
					 <li>Daisy Wheel printers</li>
				 </ul>
			 </li>
			 <li>Line printers
				 <ul>
					 <li>Drum printers</li>
					 <li>Chain printers</li>
				 </ul>
			 </li>
		 </ol>
		 
 
		 <h5>Non-impact printers: They are of two types</h5>
		 <ol>
			 <li>Laser printers</li>
			 <li>Inkjet printers</li>
		 </ol>
		 
		 <h3 id="ip">Impact Printer</h3>
		 <p>The impact printer uses a hammer or print head to print the character or images onto the paper. The hammer or print head strikes or presses an ink ribbon against the paper to print characters and images.</p>
		 <h5>Impact printers are further divided into two types.</h5>
		 <p>Character Printers</p>
		 <p>Line printers</p>
		 <h4>A) Character Printers</h4>
		 <p>Character printer prints a single character at a time or with a single stroke of the print head or hammer. It does not print one line at a time. Dot Matrix printer and Daisy Wheel printer are character printers. Today, these printers are not in much use due to their low speed and because only the text can be printed. The character printers are of two types, which are as follows:</p>
		 <h5>i) Dot Matrix Printer</h5>
		 <img src="./images/dot-matrix-printer.jpg" />
		 <p>Dot Matrix Printer is an impact printer. The characters and images printed by it are the patterns of dots. These patterns are produced by striking the ink soaked ribbon against the paper with a print head. The print head contains pins that produce a pattern of dots on the paper to form the individual characters. The print head of a 24 pin dot matrix contains more pins than a 9 pin dot matrix printer, so it produces more dots which results in better printing of characters. To produce color output, the black ribbon can be changed with color stripes. The speed of Dot Matrix printers is around 200-500 characters per second.</p>
		 <h5>i) ii) Daisy Wheel Printer</h5>
		 <img src="./images/daisy_wheel_printer.jpg" />
		 <p>Daisy Wheel Printer was invented by David S. Lee at Diablo Data Systems.It consists of a wheel or disk that has spokes or extensions and looks like a daisy, so it is named Daisy Wheel printer. At the end of extensions, molded metal characters are mounted. To print a character the printer rotates the wheel, and when the desired character is on the print location the hammer hits disk and the extension hits the ink ribbon against the paper to create the impression. It cannot be used to print graphics and is often noisy and slow, i.e., the speed is very low around 25-50 characters per second. Due to these drawbacks,these printers have become obsolete.</p>
 
 
		 <h4>B) Line Printers:</h4>
		 <p>Line printer, which is also as a bar printer, prints one line at a time. It is a high-speed impact printer as it can print 500 to 3000 lines per minute. Drum printer and chain printer are examples of line printers.</p>
 
		 <h5>i) Drum Printer:</h5>
		 <img src="./images/drum-printer.png" />
		 <p>Drum printer is a line printer that is made of a rotating drum to print characters. The drum has circular bands of characters on its surface. It has a separate hammer for each band of characters. When you print, the drum rotates, and when the desired character comes under the hammer, the hammer strikes the ink ribbon against the paper to print characters. The drum rotates at a very high speed and characters are printed by activating the appropriate hammers. Although all the characters are not printed at a time, they are printed at a very high speed. Furthermore, it can print only a predefined style as it has a specific set of characters. These printers are known to be very noisy due to the use of hammering techniques.</p>
 
		 <h5>ii) Chain Printer:</h5>
		 <img src="./images/chain-printer.png" />
		 <p>Chain printer is a line printer that uses a rotating chain to print characters. The characters are embossed on the surface of the chain. The chain rotates horizontally around a set of hammers, for each print location one hammer is provided, i.e., the total number of hammers is equal to the total number of print positions.</p>
		 <p>The chain rotates at a very high speed and when the desired character comes at the print location, the corresponding hammer strikes the page against the ribbon and character on the chain.They can type 500 to 3000 lines per minute. They are also noisy due to the hammering action.</p>
 
		 <h3 id="nip">Non-Impact Printer:</h3>
			   <p>Non-impact printers don't print characters or images by striking a print head or hammer on the ink ribbon placed against the paper. They print characters and images without direct physical contact between the paper and the printing machinery. These printers can print a complete page at a time, so they are also known as page printers. The common types of non-impact printers are Laser printer and Inkjet printer:</p>
		 <h4>i) Laser Printer:</h4>
		 <img src="./images/laser-printer.png" />
		 <p>A laser printer is a non-impact printer that uses a laser beam to print the characters. The laser beam hits the drum, which is a photoreceptor and draws the image on the drum by altering electrical charges on the drum. The drum then rolls in toner, and the charged image on the drum picks the toner. The toner is then printed on the paper using heat and pressure. Once the document is printed, the drum loses the electric charge,and the remaining toner is collected. The laser printers use powdered toner for printing instead of liquid ink and produce quality print objects with a resolution of 600 dots per inch (dpi) or more.</p>
 
		 <h4>ii) Inkjet Printer:</h4>
		 <img src="./images/inkjet-printer.png" />
		 <p>The inkjet printer is a non-impact printer that prints images and characters by spraying fine,ionized drops of ink. The print head has tiny nozzles to spray the ink. The printer head moves back and forth and sprays ionized drops of ink on the paper, which is fed through the printer. These drops pass through an electric field that guides the ink onto the paper to print correct images and characters.</p>
		 <p>An inkjet printer has cartridges that contain ink. Modern inkjet printers are color printers that have four cartridges containing different colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. It is capable of printing high-quality images with different colors. It can produce print objects with a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch (dpi).</p>
 
		 <h4>Applications of Printer</h4>
		 <ul>
			 <li>Personal and Home Use: Printers are frequently used in homes to print papers, pictures, and other personal stuff. Individuals can use them to make tangible copies of vital information or photographs for personal use.</li>
			 <li>Offices and enterprises: Printers are required in offices and enterprises. They print commercial enterprise papers, reports, contracts, invoices, and documents. Employees can utilize printers to create physical copies of crucial information, which aids in communication and record-keeping.</li>
			 <li>Education: Students and teachers utilize printers at educational institutions such as schools and universities. They are used to print assignments, worksheets, study materials, project reports, and educational tools.</li>
			 <li>Printing and Publishing: Printers are critical in the publishing and printing industries. They're used on a massive scale to print publications, including newspapers, brochures, flyers, and other published goods.</li>
			 <li>Advertising and Marketing: Printers are employed in the advertising and marketing industry to create promotional materials such as posters, banners, flyers, business cards, and product labels.</li>

				 <h2 id="components">Components of CPU</h2>
				 <img src="./images/components.png" />
				 <p>Generally, a CPU has three components:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</li>
					 <li>Control Unit</li>
					 <li>Memory or Storage Unit</li>
				 </ul>
				 
	 
				 <h3>Control Unit:</h3>
				 <p>The Control Unit (CU) is a vital part of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and is accountable for the overall performance of a computer system. It is the circuitry in the control unit, which makes use of electrical signals to instruct the computer system for executing already stored instructions. It takes instructions from memory and then decodes and executes these instructions. So, it controls and coordinates the functioning of all parts of the computer.</p>
				 <img src="./images/controlunit.png" />
				 <p>The Control Unit's main task is to maintain and regulate the flow of information across the processor. It serves as a traffic controller, ensuring that information and instructions are efficiently transferred among the various elements of the computer system. It manages the order in which instructions are executed and synchronizes the activities of various units within the CPU. It does not take part in processing and storing data. Instead, it serves as an overseer, coordinating the actions of other CPU parts to guarantee that instructions are carried out accurately and in the right order.</p>
				 <p>The Control Unit achieves coordination within the CPU through a series of steps:</p>
				 <img src="./images/cu2.png" />
	 
				 <ul>
					 <li>Fetch: The Control Unit retrieves an instruction from the computer's memory. It accomplishes this by accessing the memory location provided by the program counter (PC), which contains the address of the next instruction to be executed.</li>
					 <li>Decode: Once the instruction is fetched, the Control Unit decodes it. It breaks down the instruction into its constituent elements, which include the operation code (opcode) and any associated operands. The operands supply the data or memory locations on which the operation will be completed, while the opcode suggests the kind of operation to be done.</li>
					 <li>Execute: After the instruction is decoded, the Control Unit initiates the execution phase. It coordinates the necessary actions within the CPU's functional units, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), to perform the specific operation indicated by the instruction. This may involve calculations, data manipulations, or control operations.</li>
					 <li>Store: Once the instruction is executed, the Control Unit updates the necessary registers and flags to reflect the operation results. This could involve storing the result in a register, updating the program counter to indicate the address of the next instruction, or modifying status flags that provide information about the outcome of the operation (e.g., zero flags, carry flags).</li>
					 <li>Repeat: After updating the necessary components, the Control Unit repeats the process by fetching the next instruction from memory. It increments the program counter to point to the next instruction's address, and the cycle continues.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <p>This fetch-decode-execute cycle is repeated for each instruction in the program, allowing the Control Unit to coordinate the sequential execution of instructions and ensure that the computer system performs the required tasks.</p>
				 <p>The Control Unit ensures the correct information flow and guides the CPU's actions during this process. It eventually aids in the general operation of the computer system by allowing the CPU to carry out the required operations and computations through the fetching, decoding, and execution of instructions.</p>
	 
				 <h3>ALU:</h3>
				 <p>It is the arithmetic logic unit, which carries out arithmetic and logical operations. Included in the list of arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparisons. Data selection, comparison, and merging are the primary logical operations. More than one ALU may be present in a CPU. ALUs can also be used to keep track of timers that assist in running the computer.</p>
				 <img src="./images/alu.png" />
				 <p>The ALU consists of two main subsections: the Arithmetic Section and the Logic Section.</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>The ALU's Arithmetic Section conducts mathematical operations. It performs fundamental mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For mathematical computations in several applications and programmes, these processes are necessary. Other operations, such as bitwise operations and incrementing or decreasing values, can also be handled by the Arithmetic Section.</li>
					 <li>The ALU's Logic Section is in charge of performing logical operations. Data manipulation based on logical conditions is referred to as logical operations. These operations include choosing or removing certain data elements or fields, comparing values to identify connections (such as equal, greater than, or less than), and merging or combining data in accordance with logical principles. Decision-making, data filtering, and data processing tasks frequently employ logical operations.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <p>The ALU's arithmetic and logical functions are crucial for the execution of instructions within the CPU. The ALU is responsible for carrying out the necessary arithmetic or logical operation specified by the instruction when retrieved and decoded by the Control Unit. For instance, the Arithmetic Section of the ALU will perform the addition operation and output the result if an instruction calls for adding two integers.</p>
				 <p>Sometimes, a CPU may contain multiple ALUs to enhance its processing capabilities. Multiple ALUs can work simultaneously, allowing for parallel execution of operations and speeding up computation tasks. This is especially beneficial in CPUs with multiple cores or processors designed for high-performance computing.</p>
				 
	 
				 <h3>Memory or Storage Unit</h3>
				 <img src="./images/memory.png" />
				 <p>A computer system's memory or storage unit maintains instructions, data, and intermediate outcomes. It acts as a database that other computer components may access and save data in as needed. This device has numerous names because of its numerous functions, including internal storage unit, main memory, primary storage, or Random-access reminiscence (RAM).</p>
				 <p>The memory unit's capability directly affects the computer's speed, power, and normal performance. A memory unit with a larger ability allows for storing more data and instructions, resulting in an improved machine capacity to handle complicated tasks efficiently.</p>
				 <p>A computer system commonly has two types of memory: primary and secondary.</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Primary memory, often called RAM, is the main memory of a computer. It closely collaborates with the CPU to quickly store and retrieve data. RAM allows the computer to access information randomly, which means it can retrieve any piece of data without going through everything in order. RAM acts as a momentary workspace where the computer stores the information and applications it is now utilizing. RAM is a volatile memory, so anything saved inside is lost when the machine is switched off. How many programs can run simultaneously and how much data can be processed simultaneously depends on the RAM capacity.<br/>
						 <img src="./images/memoprimary.png" /></li>
					 <li>Secondary memory includes hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and external storage devices. Computer systems are designed to store data for extended periods, even if powered off. Secondary memory, unlike RAM, is non-volatile and maintains records even in the absence of power. It is the storage location for operating systems, software applications, documents, and user data. Secondary memory has a larger capability in comparison to RAM. While accessing data from secondary memory takes longer than primary memory, it gives the advantage of long-term data retention.<br/>
						 <img src="./images/memo secondary.png" /></li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 <h5>Some functions of the Memory unit</h5>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Storage: The memory unit stores instructions, data, and intermediate results for the computer to perform tasks.</li>
					 <li>Retrieval: The computer can access stored information quickly and efficiently, enabling the processor to retrieve data and instructions during program execution.</li>
					 <li>Temporary Storage: The memory unit provides temporary storage (RAM) for actively running programs, allowing the CPU to access and manipulate data quickly.</li>
					 <li>Data Transfer: It facilitates the transfer of data between the CPU and other components of the computer system, ensuring smooth communication and efficient processing.</li>
					 <li>Fast Access: The memory unit offers fast access to data and instructions, reducing delays in program execution and enhancing overall system performance.</li>
					 <li>Random Access: It enables the CPU to retrieve data from any location in the memory unit without searching sequentially, allowing for quick and random access to information.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
	 
				 <h2 id="cpu clock">What is CPU Clock Speed?</h2>
				 <img src="./images/couclock.png" />
				 <p>The clock speed of a processor, often known as the CPU clock rate, is an important component. The clock speed of a CPU or a processor refers to the number of instructions it can process in a second. It is measured in gigahertz. For example, a CPU with a clock speed of 4.0 GHz means it can process 4 billion instructions in a second.</p>
				 <p>The number of instructions a CPU can execute in a specific time is determined by the CPU's clock speed. Each instruction represents a fundamental CPU activity, such as transferring data or doing mathematical calculations. The clock speed determines how quickly these instructions are executed. A higher clock speed allows the CPU to process more instructions per second, enhancing overall performance.</p>
				 <p>Consider an example with a factory production line to understand better how clock speed affects CPU performance. The clock speed represents the speed at which the conveyor belt moves, bringing workpieces to different stations. The faster the conveyor belt moves; the more workpieces can be processed in a given time.</p>
				 <p>Modern CPUs also frequently use techniques like multi-core architectures and instruction pipelining to boost speed. To increase processing power overall, multi-core CPUs include numerous independent processing units (cores) that may carry out instructions concurrently. The CPU may execute many instructions simultaneously using instruction pipelining, significantly enhancing efficiency.</p>
				 <p>Because of advances in semiconductor technology, CPU clock rates have been rising continuously over time. Early CPUs operated at clock speeds measured in megahertz (MHz), but with technological progress, GHz speeds became the norm. Some high-end CPUs even surpassed the 5 GHz mark.</p>
	 
				 <h2 id="cputypes">Types of CPU:</h2>
				 <p>CPUs are mostly manufactured by Intel and AMD, each of which manufactures its own types of CPUs. In modern times, there are lots of CPU types in the market. Some of the basic types of CPUs are described below:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Single-Core CPUs</li>
					 <li>Dual-Core CPUs</li>
					 <li>Quad-Core CPUs</li>
					 <li>Hexa-Core CPUs</li>
					 <li>Octa-Core CPUs</li>
					 <li>Multi-Core CPUs</li>
				 </ul>
				 
						 
				 <h3>Single Core CPU</h3>
				 <img src="./images/singlecore.png" />
				 <p>Single Core is the oldest type of computer CPU, which was used in the 1970s. It has only one core to process different operations. It can start only one operation at a time; the CPU switches back and forth between different sets of data streams when more than one program runs. So, it is not suitable for multitasking as the performance will be reduced if more than one application runs. The performance of these CPUs is mainly dependent on the clock speed. It is still used in various devices, such as smartphones.</p>
				 <p>But as technology developed, multi-core CPUs proliferated and now provide better multitasking skills. These CPUs can execute several instructions simultaneously due to their numerous processing cores. Single-core CPUs are less popular in desktop and laptop computers, although they are still used in embedded systems and mobile phones. Smartphones often use single-core or dual-core CPUs that are particularly made for power efficiency to balance performance and battery life.</p>
				 <h3>Dual Core CPU</h3>
				 <img src="./images/dualcore.png" />
				 <p>As the name suggests, Dual Core CPU contains two cores in a single Integrated Circuit (IC). Although each core has its own controller and cache, they are linked together to work as a single unit and thus can perform faster than the single-core processors and can handle multitasking more efficiently than Single Core processors.</p>
				 <p>A dual-core CPU's two cores enable the execution of many tasks in parallel. Each core can independently execute instructions, enabling parallel processing. This capability significantly improves multitasking performance compared to single-core processors. With dual-core CPUs, users can run multiple applications simultaneously without experiencing significant performance slowdowns.</p>
				 <p>Dual-core CPUs offer benefits beyond multitasking. They can also enhance performance for single-threaded applications. Since each core can handle instructions independently, tasks that cannot be parallelized can still benefit from the dual-core architecture. One core can focus on running the main application, while the other handles background processes or system tasks. This division of work ensures a smoother user experience and improves overall system responsiveness.</p>
				 <h3>Quad Core CPU</h3>
				 <img src="./images/quadcore.png" />
				 <p>This type of CPU comes with two dual-core processors in one integrated circuit (IC) or chip. So, a quad-core processor is a chip that contains four independent units called cores. These cores read and execute instructions of CPU. The cores can run multiple instructions simultaneously, thereby increases the overall speed for programs that are compatible with parallel processing.</p>
				 <p>Quad Core CPU uses a technology that allows four independent processing units (cores) to run in parallel on a single chip. Thus, by integrating multiple cores in a single CPU, higher performance can be generated without boosting the clock speed. However, the performance increases only when the computer's software supports multiprocessing. The software which supports multiprocessing divides the processing load between multiple processors instead of using one processor at a time.</p>
				 <p>Thanks to Quad-core processors' ability to divide the processing burden among several cores, multiple processors can operate simultaneously instead of one at a time. Certain software supports this multiprocessing capacity, which improves productivity and speeds up processing times, especially for jobs that can be broken down into smaller subtasks and carried out concurrently.</p>
				 <p>Quad-core CPUs, in particular, provide advantages in terms of increased efficiency and quicker processing for multitasking and computationally heavy jobs. With four cores, the CPU can divide the workload more equally, enabling quicker reaction times and more fluid multitasking. In jobs like video editing, 3D graphics, and gaming, where simultaneous execution of numerous tasks is essential, quad-core CPUs excel in parallel processing.</p>
				 <h3>Hexa-Core CPUs</h3>
				 <img src="./images/hexacore.png" />
				 <p>Hexa-core CPUs are computer processors that include six separate cores on a single integrated circuit (IC) or chip. Each core functions as a separate processing unit that can perform computations and commands. With six cores, processing power may be boosted, and performance can be enhanced.</p>
				 <p>Regarding multitasking and managing resource-intensive tasks, Hexa-core CPUs provide substantial benefits. The CPU can perform numerous tasks simultaneously with six cores by distributing the burden among them for more effective processing. Users may operate many programs simultaneously without noticeably encountering performance slowdowns or delays, such as web browsers, video editing programs, and gaming programs.</p>
				 <p>Hexa-core CPUs also excel in applications that demand significant computational power, such as video editing, 3D rendering, scientific simulations, and virtualization. These tasks can be distributed across multiple cores, resulting in faster processing and reduced waiting times.</p>
				 <h3>Octa-Core CPUs</h3>
				 <img src="./images/octacore.png" />
				 <p>Octa-core CPUs are computer processors with eight separate cores on a single integrated circuit (IC) or chip. Each core performs as a separate processing unit that can perform calculations and commands. An octa-core CPU's eight cores considerably boost processing power and overall performance.</p>
				 <p>Octa-core CPUs excel at performing demanding workloads and have impressive multitasking capabilities. With eight cores, the CPU can effectively manage multiple simultaneous tasks. The workload is distributed across the cores, allowing for efficient processing and faster completion of tasks. This means users can run numerous applications simultaneously without experiencing significant performance slowdowns or system lag.</p>
				 <p>The key advantage of octa-core CPUs is their ability to execute instructions in parallel. Each core can independently work on different tasks, allowing for concurrent processing. This parallel processing capacity enhances system performance overall and speeds up operations. It is especially beneficial for undertakings that may be divided into smaller tasks and finished simultaneously.</p>
				 <p>Octa-core CPUs are best suited for computationally intensive software that requires many resources. High-definition video editing, 3D rendering, intricate scientific simulations, and virtualization are among the examples. These workloads may be effectively divided across several cores, resulting in quicker processing and shorter wait times.</p>
				 <h3>Multi-Core CPUs</h3>
				 <p>Multi-core CPUs, also known as multi-core processors, are kinds of computer processors that combine several independent cores onto a single chip or integrated circuit. Multi-core CPUs use two or extra cores that work collectively to execute instructions and do computations, in contrast to single-core processors, which rely upon a single core to complete all activities.</p>
				 <p>The primary advantage of multi-core CPUs is their capability to deal with numerous tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance and efficiency. The CPU's cores perform as separate processing units that can operate independently. Due to the CPU's ability to distribute work across its cores through parallel processing, jobs may be completed more quickly and concurrently.</p>
				 <p>Users may run numerous programs simultaneously on multi-core CPUs without suffering severe slowdowns or performance bottlenecks. For instance, each job may be given to a different core for effective processing, allowing you to browse the web, stream movies, and work on paper simultaneously. This multitasking feature makes the system more responsive overall and provides a more convenient user experience.</p>
				 <p>Multi-core CPUs excel at performing computationally demanding activities in addition to multitasking. These processors can handle complicated activities like video editing, 3D rendering, scientific simulations, and gaming more effectively by distributing the burden among numerous cores. The ability to distribute the workload across cores results in faster processing times and reduced waiting periods</p>

				 <ul>
					 <li>Printer: A printer is a hardware output device used to produce hard copies of documents or print them. It converts computer-generated electronic data into printed form. Text files, pictures, or a combination of the two can all be considered documents. It receives input commands from users so that computers or other devices may print the sheets. You must create a soft copy of your report and print it using a printer, for example, if your institution needs you to submit a project report.<br/>
						 <img src="./images/hardware-printer.jpg" /></li>
					 <li>Speaker:One of the most popular output devices is a speaker that connects to a computer to generate a sound output. While some speakers can only be connected to computers, others can be used with any type of sound system.<br/>
						 <img src="./images/hardware-speaker.jpg" /></li>
					 <li>Headphones, earphones, earbuds:
						 These are also output devices much like speakers, which offer audio that can only be heard by one listener.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
				 
				 <h2 id="hardwarevssoftware">Hardware vs. software</h2>
				 <p>Hardware describes the physical parts of the computer or its delivery mechanisms that hold and execute the software's written instructions. The intangible component of the system software enables the user to communicate with the hardware and give commands to perform specific tasks. Computer software includes:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>OS and associated tools;</li>
					 <li>Applications that regulate particular computer operations</li>
					 <li>Programs that generally operate on data provided by the user</li>
				 </ul>
		 
				 <p>Virtual keyboards are not physical keyboards; therefore, they are also considered software on mobile devices and laptop computers.</p>
				 <p>The software must be developed to function properly with the hardware because they both are necessary for a computer to create usable output. Also, they depend on each other.</p>
				 <p>If any system has malware or malicious software, such as worms, spyware, viruses, and Trojan horses, they can have a significant impact on software and the operating system of a system. Malware, however, has no effect on hardware.</p>
				 <p>On the other hand, malware can impact the system in additional ways. For example, it can use up a lot of memory of the system or even reproduce itself to take up the entire hard drive. This can stop reliable programs from working and causes the computer to run slowly. Furthermore, users may not be able to access the files stored on the computer's hardware due to malware.</p>
		 
				 <h2 id="hardware virtualization">What is hardware virtualization?</h2>
				 <p>The abstraction of physical computing resources from the software that utilizes those resources is known as hardware virtualization. Put on another way; hardware virtualization is the process of creating virtual representations of hardware by using software rather than physical, tangible hardware components for various computing functions</p>
				 <p>A particular hardware platform by host software is used to execute hardware virtualization, and it is sometimes referred to as platform or server virtualization. It needs a hypervisor, a virtual machine manager that turns internal hardware into virtual forms. As a result, among OSes and applications, the hardware resources of one physical machine can be shared easily and used more efficiently.</p>
				 <p>In cloud computing, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), a delivery model that offers hardware resources over high-speed internet, is frequently associated with hardware virtualization. All of the hardware elements that are typically found in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage, and networking hardware, as well as the software that enables virtualization, are hosted by a cloud service provider (CSP), such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure.</p>
				 <p>IaaS and CSPs differ from hardware as a service (HaaS) providers in that they don't host software but only host hardware. A typical IaaS provider also offers a variety of services to go along with infrastructure parts, like the following:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>billing</li>
					 <li>clustering</li>
					 <li>log access</li>
					 <li>monitoring</li>
					 <li>security</li>
					 <li>load balancing</li>
				 </ul>
		 
				 <p>Other storage resilience services are also provided by some CSPs, including disaster recovery, automated backup, and replication.</p>
		 
				 <h3>What is hardware as a service?</h3>
				 <p>While buying computer hardware and occasionally replacing or upgrading it is common for individuals or businesses. People and businesses can also rent physical and virtual hardware from a service provider. The maintenance of the hardware, including all of its numerous physical parts and the software that runs on them, becomes the responsibility of the service provider. It is also called the HaaS model.</p>
				 <p>The most significant advantage of HaaS is it decreases the price of purchasing and maintaining hardware, allowing businesses to switch from a capital expenditure budget to a typically cheaper operational expense budget. Additionally, the majority of HaaS options are based on a pay-as-you-go model, which makes it simpler for businesses in order to manage expenditures while still having access to the hardware they require for their operational and business continuity.</p>
				 <p>HaaS involves installing physical parts that belong to a managed service provider (MSP) at a client's location. The responsibilities of both parties are defined by an SLA (service-level agreement).</p>
				 <p>For using the MSP's hardware, the customer may either pay a monthly cost or have it included in the MSP's fee schedule for setting up, maintaining, and monitoring the hardware. In either case, the MSP is in charge of fixing or replacing the hardware if it breaks down or becomes outdated.</p>
				 <p>Decommissioning hardware may involve physically destroying hard drives, deleting confidential data, and verifying that used equipment has been recycled legally on the basis of the SLA's requirements.</p>
		 
				 <h3>Computer hardware problems and diagnostics methods</h3>
				 <p>In modern times, troubleshooting computer hardware issues has become more convenient, faster, and easier as well. You can quickly determine which equipment is having problems if you have the correct IT inventory management tool.</p>
				 <p>The effectiveness of management procedures is greatly improved by automated IT inventory management software. You can deliver the best services by correlating, analyzing, and tracking changes with the help of these tools for asset management. They enable you to produce detailed records and define maintenance timeframes, which make it simpler to track the performance of each asset and reduce the need for manual updates.</p>
				 <p>The software has the ability to monitor hardware warranty, and expiration dates in addition to tracking and identifying hardware faults. These functions assist you in service level agreements, organizing upcoming purchases, and procurement plans in accordance with corporate requirements. The asset automatically updates the inventory as necessary if it finds configuration changes and performance issues. Software for managing hardware inventories can perform the following things, for example:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Immediately gather IT inventory data and auto-discover assets.</li>
					 <li>Send immediate warnings regarding CPU and motherboard hardware problems or when your operating system, firmware, and software upgrades are available.</li>
					 <li>Keep track of any server operating system upgrades.</li>
					 <li>Track and manage the maintenance requirements and life cycles of the hardware inventory.</li>
					 <li>Also, with powerful IT inventory management software, you can identify and monitor configuration changes.</li>
				 </ul>
		 
				 
		 
		 
				 <h1>Software</h1>
				 <a href="#system">System Software</a><br/>
				 <a href="#application">Application Software</a><br/>
				 <a href="#programming">Programming Software</a><br/>
				 <p>Software, which is abbreviated as SW or S/W, is a set of programs that enables the hardware to perform a specific task. All the programs that run the computer are software. The software can be of three types: system software, application software, and programming software.</p>
				 <h2  id="system">1) System Software</h2>
				 <p>The system software is the main software that runs the computer. When you turn on the computer, it activates the hardware and controls and coordinates their functioning. The application programs are also controlled by system software. An operating system is an example of system software.</p>
		 
				 <h3 id="operating">i) Operating System:</h3>
				 <p>An operating system is the system software that works as an interface to enable the user to communicate with the computer. It manages and coordinates the functioning of hardware and software of the computer. The commonly used operating systems are Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple Mac OS X.
		 
		 </p>
		 
				 <h4 id="example">Some other examples of system software include:</h4>
				 <ul>
					 <li>BIOS: It stands for basic input output system. It is a type of system software, which is stored in Read Only Memory (ROM) located on the motherboard. However, in advanced computer systems, it is stored in flash memory. BIOS is the first software that gets activated when you turn on your computer system. It loads the drivers of the hard disk into memory as well as assists the operating system to load itself into the memory.</li>
					 <li>Boot Program: Boot refers to starting up a computer. When you switch on the computer, the commands in the ROM are executed automatically to load the boot program into memory and execute its instructions. The BIOS program has a basic set of commands that enables the computer to perform the basic input/output instructions to start the computer.</li>
					 <li>An assembler: It plays the role of a converter as it receives basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits. The processor uses these bits to perform basic operations.</li>
					 <li>A device driver: This system software controls hardware devices connected to a computer. It enables the computer to use the hardware by providing an appropriate interface. The kernel of a Computer's CPU communicates with different hardware through this software. Operating systems generally come with most of the device drivers. If the operating system does not have a device driver for hardware, you have to install the device driver before using that hardware device.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
		 
				 <h2 id="application">2) Application Software:</h2>
				 <p>Application software is a set of programs designed to perform a specific task. It does not control the working of a computer as it is designed for end-users. A computer can run without application software. Application software can be easily installed or uninstalled as required. It can be a single program or a collection of small programs. Microsoft Office Suite, Adobe Photoshop, and any other software like payroll software or income tax software are application software. As we know, they are designed to perform specific tasks. Accordingly, they can be of different types such as:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Word Processing Software: This software allows users to create, edit, format, and manipulate the text and more. It offers lots of options for writing documents, creating images, and more. For example, MS Word, WordPad, Notepad, etc.</li>
					 <li>Spreadsheet Software: It is designed to perform calculations, store data, create charts, etc. It has rows and columns, and the data is entered in the cell, which is an intersection of a row and column, e.g., Microsoft Excel.</li>
					 <li>Multimedia Software: These software are developed to perform editing of video, audio, and text. It allows you to combine texts, videos, audio, and images. Thus, you can improve a text document by adding photos, animations, graphics, and charts through multimedia software. For example, VLC player, Window Media Player, etc.</li>
					 <li>Enterprise Software: These software are developed for business operational functions. It is used in large organizations where the quantum of business is too large. It can be used for accounting, billing, order processing and more. For example, CRM (Customer Relationship Management), BI (Business Intelligence), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), SCM (Supply Chain Management), customer support system, and more.</li>
				 </ul>
				 
		 
				 <h2 id="programming">3) Programming Software:</h2>
				 <p>It is a set or collection of tools that help developers in writing other software or programs. It assists them in creating, debugging, and maintaining software or programs or applications. We can say that these are facilitator software that helps translate programming language such as Java, C++, Python, etc., into machine language code. So, it is not used by end-users. For example, compilers, linkers, debuggers, interpreters, text editors, etc. This software is also called a programming tool or software development tool.</p>
				 <p>Some examples of programming software include:</p>
				 <ul>
					 <li>Eclipse: It is a java language editor.</li>
					 <li>Coda: It is a programming language editor for Mac.</li>
					 <li>Notepad++: It is an open-source editor for windows.</li>
					 <li>Sublime text: It is a cross-platform code editor for Linux, Mac, and Windows.</li>
